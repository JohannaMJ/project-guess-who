# Project Name

Individual project to create a "Guess Who" game by using game logic, forEach loops and arrays.

## The problem

I have created the project by using different functions and eventlisteners. I have used foreach loops, arrays and if-else conditionals. When the game worked as planned I added some attributes to the characters so that there are more options in the drop-down list. To round off I added a timer and a counter to keep track of how long time the game was played and how many questions were asked.  
If I had more time I would like to add some audio features for the alert messages.
